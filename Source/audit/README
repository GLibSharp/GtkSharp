The audit/ folder contains various tools that are used to analyze API changes.

This analysis is done by inspecting the assembly binaries, so you need to
compile them first.

The usual workflow is as follows:

1. Generate the API info for the current version of the assemblies

    ./get-apiinfo.pl .. data/curr

This will find all *.dll files in Gtk#, produce one <assembly-name>.apiinfo
file per DLL, and save them in the data/curr folder

2. Analyze differences between a baseline and the current API info

    ./get-apidiff.pl base data/curr data/diff

This will generate one <assembly-name>.apidiff file for each *.apiinfo file in
the base folder, and save it in the data/diff folder.

3. Generate an HTML report for the API differences

    mono gen-apidiff-html.exe data/diff html/diff.html

This will use the data in data/diff to generate a single HTML file and save it
as html/diff.html. You can then open this file in a browser to review the API
changes.
